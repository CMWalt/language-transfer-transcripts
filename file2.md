## Troubleshooting

*   **No Output:** Make sure the plugin is installed, enabled, *and* that you've configured the settings correctly (repository URL, branch name, and Personal Access Token).  Also, ensure the repository and branch actually exist and contain files.
*   **Errors:** Check the error messages displayed in TypingMind. They usually provide clues about what went wrong (e.g., invalid token, incorrect URL, network issues).
* See previous "Troubleshooting"

## Important Notes

*   This plugin fetches *all* files in the specified repository and branch. There's currently no way to select specific files.
* The token should have read-only access.
